<h2>Project Status</h2>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> Completed</p>

<p><strong>Institution:</strong> KLE Technological University, Hubballi</p>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
This REU project integrates experimental submerged fermentation studies
with data-driven machine learning models to analyze, predict, and optimize
marine protease production. A marine-derived bacterial isolate was employed
for extracellular protease production, and fermentation kinetics were
experimentally monitored. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest
models were developed to capture nonlinear relationships between fermentation
parameters and enzyme activity.
</p>
<h2>Problem Statement & Motivation</h2>
<p>
Conventional optimization of enzyme production relies heavily on
trial-and-error experimentation, which is time-consuming and resource
intensive. Fermentation systems exhibit nonlinear behavior influenced
by multiple interacting parameters, making prediction difficult using
classical approaches alone.
</p>

<p>
Marine microorganisms offer robust enzymes with superior stability,
but systematic modeling and optimization of marine protease production
remain limited. This project aimed to bridge experimental fermentation
studies with artificial intelligence–based modeling to improve prediction
and support data-driven bioprocess optimization.
