# AI-Driven Modeling and Optimization of Marine Protease Production

This repository documents a completed **Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)** project focused on integrating experimental biotechnology with machine learning–based modeling for enzyme production analysis.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The project investigates **marine protease production under submerged fermentation** conditions and applies **data-driven modeling approaches** to predict and analyze enzyme activity. Experimental fermentation data were combined with artificial intelligence techniques to understand nonlinear bioprocess behavior and support intelligent optimization.

---

## 🧪 What Was Done
- Isolation and screening of a marine protease-producing bacterial isolate  
- Submerged batch fermentation and time-course monitoring  
- Estimation of biomass growth, substrate utilization, and enzyme activity  
- Fermentation kinetics analysis  
- Development and evaluation of **ANN** and **Random Forest** regression models  

---

## 📊 Key Outcomes
- Protease production showed growth-associated behavior  
- Machine learning models accurately predicted enzyme activity  
- Random Forest model achieved superior performance (R² ≈ 0.98)  
- Fermentation time identified as the most influential parameter
